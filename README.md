We work on the front-end of a web page, using Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 in a simple way. So, here we work with the MVP (Minimum Viable Product),
just to test knowledge in HTML5, and, CSS3, as well as Javascript. We have responsive work here with adjustments for screens smaller and larger
than the average standard.
